# OracleDataCloudDataSet
- The training set and validation sets have been posted to S3 at s3://cu-codata/public/odc/train_set.tar.gz and s3://cu-codata/public/odc/val_set.tar.gz. They are each 7GB and decompressed 35GB, and can be downloaded after making an AWS account with http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/. We know this is inconvenient and a top priority task is to extract a reasonable subset of the data set that is easy to get started on (I will also probably make a small machine on our open stack cluster you can scp the data from instead of S3). Its definitely not necessary to use the entire data set for training.
- We won’t be using Kaggle leaderboard for this one since it didn’t have the correct evaluation criteria. Instead Oracle will provide an evaluation script. The idea is to train on the train set and compute a leaderboard like number of the validation set. Anticipating popular demand I have of course creating #bragging-rights channel so you can share your super awesome scores
- Evaluation will be the following: Given ~1 million rows, identify 100,000 rows to advertise to. The score is the revenue generated by advertising to these rows (sum of the spend values). The second is the fraction of the 100k that spent more than $0. We will announce the split between these two metrics but expect that doing well in one means you will do well in the other.
